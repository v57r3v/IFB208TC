INSTRUCTIONS TO STUDENTS
REPORT STRUCTURE
         COVER   PAGE - your   Cover   Page   should   be the   same   as the   Taicang   Official   Cover   Page.   Make   sure,   however,to fill   in all   pertinent details such as   (i)   module code   and   title;   (ii)   student   name   and   ID;   (iii)   title of your coursework, (iv) word count, etc.   Besides the Taicang Official Cover   Page,   you are   also to   include   a   separate   Title   Page   with   the   following   information:   (i)   module   code   and   title;   (ii)   student   name   and   student   number;   (iii) title   of your   coursework;   (iv)   module   leader.   Feel free to   design the   title   page   according   to   your   preferences   while   ensuring   it   adheres   to   the   professional   standards   typically followed   in   business and   management   reports.
            MAIN BODY   - the report should embrace a question-answer structure. In other words, you must NOT   combine either the questions or the   answers.   Also, you   are   advised   to   use   sections   and   subsections.   Make    sure    to    identify      each      section      and      subsection      using      Arabic      numbers.      Sections      should      be   numbered    1.,   2.,   etc.,   and   subsections   should    be    numbered    1.1,    1.2,    etc.    Importantly,    since   the   questions are   not connected, you are   NOT expected   to   include   an   Introduction   and   a   Conclusion.
            REFERENCES - all secondary sources including   books, journal articles, conference   papers, etc., which   have   been   used to   produce this assignment must   be cited accordingly. This coursework   requires that   you   use   the   Harvard   (Referencing)   Style   also   known   as   the   Harvard   Referencing   System.   If   you   are   not   familiar   with   the   Harvard   Referencing   System,    please,   make   sure   to   consult   the    Internet   for   additional                   details.                      For                      instance,                   you                      may                      check                   the                      following                   source:   https://www.mendeley.com/guides/harvard-citation-guide/.      Importantly,    any    secondary      sources   you   use for   solving the   questions   must   be   listed   right   after your   answer.   In   other words, you   should   have three   reference sections   (one for each question)   instead of   one.
            LENGTH   - based on the requirements on p.2, the entire document must be between   1,250 and   1,550   words (*excluding title   page,   references, tables, graphs and figures).   Importantly, should you decide   to include an Introduction and a Conclusion, both sections will be counted towards the allowed word   limit.   With   this    in    mind,    reports    below    the    minimum    or    above    the    maximum   threshold    will    be   penalised accordingly.   For every   10-20 words   less/   more, you will   be deducted   1% of   the   final   mark.   For   instance,   if your   report stands at   1,550 words, you will   be deducted   3%   of the   final   mark.
